# VDifFusion
Code of VDifFusion: A Visual Language-Driven Diffusion-Based Approach for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion

## Tips:<br>
1.Due to file size issues, the training set has been removed from the code and the MSRS dataset can be downloaded here: https://github.com/Linfeng-Tang/MSRS
Place the downloaded training dataset under: ./data/MSRS/Visible/train path and ./data/MSRS/Infrared/train path.

2.The unzipped pre-trained model of CLIP should be placed in the current directory. You can download the pre-training model for CLIP from the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/130fCUOwhU49dBfA9zFmX7M21WWI92Anz/view?usp=sharing.

## To Train
Run "** python train_clip.py**" to train your model.
The training data are selected from the MSRS dataset. 

## To Test
Run "** python test.py**" to test the model.
The images generated by the test will be placed under the ./result/MSRS path.
